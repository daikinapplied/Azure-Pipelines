# Azure Pipelines
The initial goal is to start with Azure DevOps Pipelines Task groups, a collection of Pipeline tasks pulled together as a single re-usable task within a project.

Side note: it is best to have all GIT repos in a single Azure DevOps Project to allow centralized collaboration of Boards.  This is different from the TFVC days of VSTS.
